# LogicGateIDE
A basic IDE for the LogicGateSimulator programming language. It provides basic syntax highlighting and consolidates the actions of 
creating, saving, and running logic gate programs into one application.  

NOTE: The .exe created after building the project "LogicGateSim" called LogicGateSim.exe must be in your path when running programs from  
this application. The project can be found here: https://github.com/RyanB156/LogicGateSimulator  
  
The application is written in WPF and uses a Scintilla control as the text area to provide line numbers and syntax highlighting.  
I experimented with the richtextbox from WPF and got highlighting to work, but it does not support line numbers.
